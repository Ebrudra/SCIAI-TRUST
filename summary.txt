Our conversation began with you setting design preferences for the project, emphasizing a focus on production-ready, beautiful UIs using existing technologies like React, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide React.

Subsequently, you reported several issues:

Console warnings: "Multiple GoTrueClient instances detected" and "Profile loading timeout".
Application stuck: The app was getting stuck in a loading state during PDF extraction, despite console logs indicating successful extraction.
Authentication problems: Issues with logout leading to a white page, persistent authentication after refreshing, and the analysis history page being stuck.
I then provided a plan to address these authentication and loading issues, which you requested to implement. However, you later confirmed that these initial fixes did not resolve the problems, reiterating the console warnings and loading issues.

In response, I performed a comprehensive rebuild of the project, focusing on:

Supabase client: Ensuring a single instance to eliminate "Multiple GoTrueClient" warnings.
Authentication context: Rewriting AuthContext for faster initialization, better error handling, and immediate state updates on sign-in/sign-out.
Core components: Enhancing App.tsx and UploadSection.tsx for improved navigation, state management, and robust error recovery during PDF processing.
API service: Optimizing database interactions with better error handling and retry logic.
The aim of these latest changes is to resolve all reported authentication, loading, and PDF extraction issues, providing a more stable and responsive application.


The SciAI Trust Toolkit is a comprehensive platform designed to assist researchers with AI-powered analysis of scientific papers, emphasizing ethics, transparency, and collaboration.

Here's a breakdown of its current state:

Core Functionality:

Paper Analysis: Users can upload PDF files or provide identifiers (DOI, ArXiv, PubMed, URL) for AI-driven summarization. The system extracts key points, limitations, and citations from the papers.
Ethical AI Analysis: The platform includes features to detect potential biases and ethical concerns within research papers, providing ethics flags with severity levels, descriptions, and recommendations.
Explainable AI (XAI): It offers insights into the AI's decision-making process, including confidence breakdowns, decision pathways, source references, and attention weights, promoting transparency.
Research Gap Identification: The AI can identify potential research gaps and suggest future work opportunities based on the analyzed content.
LLM Provider Selection: Users have the flexibility to choose between OpenAI GPT-4 and Google Gemini for the AI analysis, with a fallback mechanism if API keys are not configured or if an API call fails.
User Authentication & Management: The application integrates with Supabase for user sign-up, sign-in, and profile management. An admin dashboard is available for managing platform statistics, user feedback, and ethics alerts.
Collaboration Features: Users can manage workspaces, invite collaborators, and engage in discussions through a commenting system on analyses.
Sharing & Export: Summaries can be shared via generated links with configurable access (public/private, comments, download). Analyses can also be exported in various formats like PDF, DOCX, Markdown, JSON, and CSV.
History Tracking: Users can view their past paper uploads and AI analysis history.
Academic Integrity: Features like AI usage declarations are in place to promote responsible use of AI-generated content in research.
Current Status and Recent Improvements:

Based on our previous discussions and the current codebase, significant efforts have been made to enhance the application's stability and reliability. Specifically:

Authentication Stability: The authentication context (src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx) has been refactored to ensure a single Supabase client instance (src/lib/supabase.ts), aiming to resolve issues like "Multiple GoTrueClient instances detected" and "Profile loading timeout." This also includes improvements for more robust sign-in/sign-out flows.
PDF Processing Robustness: The UploadSection.tsx and src/services/pdfProcessor.ts include enhanced error handling and progress tracking during PDF extraction. The LLMService.ts also incorporates a comprehensive fallback analysis mechanism if the primary LLM API calls encounter issues, ensuring that users still receive some form of analysis.
Database Schema: The Supabase database is well-structured with tables for papers, summaries, user feedback, AI usage declarations, comments, share links, notifications, workspaces, activity logs, and user profiles, supporting the application's features.
The application is designed to be production-ready with a focus on a clean, modern UI using React, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide React.
