Our conversation began with you setting design preferences for the project, emphasizing a focus on production-ready, beautiful UIs using existing technologies like React, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide React.

Subsequently, you reported several issues:

Console warnings: "Multiple GoTrueClient instances detected" and "Profile loading timeout".
Application stuck: The app was getting stuck in a loading state during PDF extraction, despite console logs indicating successful extraction.
Authentication problems: Issues with logout leading to a white page, persistent authentication after refreshing, and the analysis history page being stuck.
I then provided a plan to address these authentication and loading issues, which you requested to implement. However, you later confirmed that these initial fixes did not resolve the problems, reiterating the console warnings and loading issues.

In response, I performed a comprehensive rebuild of the project, focusing on:

Supabase client: Ensuring a single instance to eliminate "Multiple GoTrueClient" warnings.
Authentication context: Rewriting AuthContext for faster initialization, better error handling, and immediate state updates on sign-in/sign-out.
Core components: Enhancing App.tsx and UploadSection.tsx for improved navigation, state management, and robust error recovery during PDF processing.
API service: Optimizing database interactions with better error handling and retry logic.
The aim of these latest changes is to resolve all reported authentication, loading, and PDF extraction issues, providing a more stable and responsive application.
